# What is React

- React is a library
- A front end tool [Cllient Side]



# What are components

- is a function that takes in raw data (props)
- returns user interface (JSX)

# ReactDOM.render()
- It is function that gets called one time only within our app
- inserts a react element into the DOM

# folders/files we want to be concerned about

- index.html - DOM, this is where we define the DOM node that our React application is going to live inside of
- index.js this is where we are performing some DOM manipulation 
- src folder - this is where all the components will be defined in

Component files must be capitalized with a .js ending
